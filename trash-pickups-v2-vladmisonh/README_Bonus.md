## Missed Trash Pickups

The city is considering different ways to calculate fines. Here are two methods that are being considered. Calculate the total fines that would be collected by each and compare that total to the amount collected using the current method.


### Alternative Method 1:

For each address, if there are three or more missed pickups within a 180-day period, damages of $1500 will be charged. (A fine will be levied every time three unique missed pickup dates occur within a six-month period for a single address.)


### Alternative Method 2:

This method also considers the six-month window like Alternative Method 1, but each date can only be used once to support a fine. How will this difference impact the fines levied? (Example: If Jan 1st, Mar 3rd, Apr 8th, and Aug 9th were the only four dates a trash pickup was missed, the original method would result in $3000 in fines [Jan, Mar, Apr, and also Mar, Apr, Aug]. However, this updated method would only result in $1500 because neither Mar nor Apr can be used for another fine since they were already used.)
