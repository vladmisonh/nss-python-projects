## Pandas Checkpoint

Read the data from disney_plus.csv into a pandas DataFrame.

1. Create a new dataframe named "movies_df" consisting of only movies.

2. Create a new dataframe named "movie_ratings" from movies_df that consists of the top 5 ratings by count. This dataframe should consist of only two columns, rating and count.

3. Use the movie_ratings dataframe to create a bar chart showing count of the top 5 ratings.

4. Using the movies_df, subset the data to create a new dataframe named "year_duration" that only consists of 2 columns, release_year and duration.

5. Find min, max, and average duration of movies from the 1975-1984.

6. Create a scatterplot using year_duration that looks at movie durations over the years.  Do you notice any correlation from inspecting the scatterplot?

7. Find the actual correlation value, is there any correlation?

8. Use movie_df to find which year had the most G-rated releases. Can you do this in a single line of code?

9. Which year had the most movie releases?  What percentage of movies that year had durations over 2 hours?

10. Create a new column in movies_df that catagorizes each movie as either short, average, or long.  Short movies should be 30 mins or less, long movies should be over 2 hours.

11. Make a pie chart of the above movie lengths.

12. Which movie had the greatest gap from the year it was released to the year it was added?  What is the average number of years between release to being added?

13. How many movies were added during the first year after the pandemic lockdown? (Assume the lockdown began on March 16, 2020)

14. How many movies have been added on your birthday?

15. How many TV shows or Movies have the word 'dog' in the title regardless if it is capitalized?
